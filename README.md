## üëã Hey there, I'm Robert DeLuca!

I'm a seasoned software engineer specializing in front-end development, but my passion extends far
beyond the browser. I love crafting beautiful, accessible, and engaging user experiences, whether
that's through web apps, native applications, or backend APIs. With a strong track record in
open-source contributions, accessibility advocacy, and deep dives into frameworks like Ember.js and
React.js, I'm always up for building something amazing!

**I'm open to interesting work‚Äîfeel free to [contact me via my
website](https://robertdelu.ca)!**
